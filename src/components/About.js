                        Water companies that sell 5 gallon bottles typically use reverse osmosis (RO) to purify the water. The process of RO involves passing water through a semi-permeable membrane that removes impurities and contaminants from the water.

                        Here's a brief overview of how the process works:

                        Pre-filtration: Water from the source (such as a municipal water supply) is first passed through a pre-filter to remove large particles and debris.

                        Carbon filtration: The pre-filtered water is then passed through activated carbon filters, which remove chlorine and other organic compounds that can affect taste and odor.

                        Reverse osmosis: The carbon-filtered water is then pressurized and forced through a semi-permeable membrane that separates out impurities and contaminants such as dissolved minerals, heavy metals, and bacteria. The purified water then passes through a post-filter to remove any remaining particles and improve taste.

                        Storage and distribution: The purified water is then stored in 5-gallon bottles and distributed to customers.

                        Overall, reverse osmosis is a highly effective method for purifying water and removing impurities.
